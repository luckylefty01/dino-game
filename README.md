# dino-game

Here I recreated the google dino game when you have no service

It uses HTML, CSS for the world scaling, score, ground, dino and cacti, as well as JavaScript to make it work. 

Currently the game will only work on computers as it requires keys to make the dino run and move. I will be looking into how I can get it to work on mobile devices to recreate the game in its entirety.
